  `Taylor Swift's first album is called <span style="font-style: italic">Taylor  Swift</span>. It was released way back on the 24th of October, 2006. It is also called the debut or self-titled album. A lot of people go back to this album when they miss Taylor's country music and her country accent. As soon as the Taylor's version of this album is released, this section will be changed.`,
  `Fearless is Taylor Swift's second album, released on the 11th of November, 2008. Its rerecording was released on the 9th of April, 2021, making it the first album to have Taylor's Version. The album is full of songs about innocent and naive teenage love as the album was written in her teenage years, so if you feel like going back to high school again, this album is for you.`,
  `The third album is called "Speak Now", whose stolen version and Taylor's Version were released on the 25th of October, 2010, and the 7th of July, 2023, respectively. This album has royalty, castles, and magic vibes, so if you feel like living out your fairy tale fantasy where you meet your prince charming in his white horse, this album is for you.`,
  `Red is the fourth album, released on the 22nd of October, 2012, for the stolen version and the 12th of November, 2021, for the Taylor's Version. If you are in love or going through heartbreak that you just want to scream it all out, blast this album in your room.`,
  `1989 is Taylor Swift's fifth album, released on the 27th of October, 2014. It is the fourth album to get a Taylor's Version, which was released on the same day in 2023. 1989 comes from the fact that Taylor Swift was born in that year. This album is also her first official pop album, which has a lot of cool, modern city vibes. If you want something to listen to as you are driving through a city or traveling to a new place or country, look no further than this album.`,
  `The sixth album is called <span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span> (stylized in lowercase letters), which was released on the 10th of November, 2017. Taylor Swift released this album during her "cancelled era", which was a period of time when her reputation was in shambles because of the amount of hate she got. The hate was mainly perpetuated by Kanye West and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian when they schemed to release an edited video footage of a phone call between Taylor and Kanye. The footage made it look like Taylor had approved of the obscene and misogynistic lyrics involving her in Kanye's new song. Taylor denied this and retaliated on her social platforms. As a result, Kim called Taylor a snake for being a "liar", which almost everyone then followed to do. The whole incident allowed other people and even news reporters to make negative assumptions about Taylor Swift, causing Taylor to go into hiding for 1 year. In August 2017, Taylor released <span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span>'s lead single "Look What You Made Me Do", a dark and edgy song that was nothing like her other songs. Its music video contained a lot of snakes, which would then become the album's symbol as Taylor's way of reclaiming the insult that she was continuously branded as. Later on, it was revealed that the phone calls that Kim released were, in fact, edited and manipulated to make Taylor Swift look bad. Long story short, <span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span> contains songs about betrayal, anger, sadness, and being at your lowest point in life but also finding the most genuine love in the world when everyone in it hates you.`,
  `Lover is Taylor Swift's seventh album and the first album she owns the rights to, which means it does not need a Taylor's Version. Since this is her first fully owned album, this will also be the non-stolen album where you can hear her youngest voice after she releases the Taylor's Version of <span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Taylor Swift</span>. As the album's name suggests, the album contains a lot of love, happy, and hopeful songs, especially since this is the era when she expressed the heartfelt love that she found solace in and helped her break free from the hate she received in the last era. Contrary to <span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span>'s black and white aesthetic that represents betrayal and sadness, this album has a very colorful and vibrant aesthetic, exuding an energy full of fun and joy that is perfect for anyone who just went through a great storm. If you are a hopeless romantic or are looking to find songs for your wedding, this album got you covered!`,
  `<span style="font-style: italic">folklore</span> is Taylor Swift's eighth album and her first album during the COVID-19 pandemic, released on the 24th of July, 2020. This is the album where Taylor showcases her poetic artistry. A lot of people tend to miss out on her music because they think she just writes generic pop songs about her exes or teenage love, but that's because that is all they hear on the radio or in public. This album is art and poetry combined and is not the pop music you are accustomed to; it makes you feel at peace and at ease when you are immersed in it. People are bound to change their minds about Taylor when they give this album a listen.`,
  `<span style="font-style: italic">evermore</span> is Taylor Swift's ninth album and <span style="font-style: italic">folklore</span>'s sister album, which was released on the 11th of December, 2020, shortly after <span style="font-style: italic">folklore</span>. This album makes you feel like a witch alone in a remote forest, peacefully living in your wooden hut while donning your long, flowy dress. This album is rarely played anywhere because it is not meant to be palatable to the general public; it is meant to be found and actively searched for like a hidden gem, just like how the album makes you feel like a lone witch hidden in the middle of a forest, away from the eyes of the people in the city.`,
  `The tenth album "Midnights" was released on the 21st of October, 2022. Midnights overall gives a nocturnal or nighttime ambiance, as its name suggests, making it suitable to dance to late at night. It comprises depressing and jolly songs that are v e r y relatable. It also has encouraging songs that help you find your light again in your darkest hours. You will also find some songs about insecurities and chasing your dreams. There are also songs that make you feel sexy and songs that make you resurface your hopeless romantic self again after promising yourself that you wouldn't be one anymore. Midnights being such a diverse album with a nighttime atmosphere, it is everything you need for some late-hour music.`,
  `The Tortured Poets Department (shortened to TTPD) is Taylor Swift's eleventh and latest album up to date. Two hours after the album's release on the 19th of April, 2024, Taylor quickly followed it up with the release of its double album subtitled "The Anthology", which contained 15 additional songs, making this album the longest among the others. This album, primarily consisting of heartbreak and sad songs, has the poetically heaviest lyrics, which lives up to its name "Tortured Poets". This is the epitome of poetry in music form. Just like many others, you may find it hard to digest the songs at first, but after a couple of listens, you will find yourself either in awe or rolling in bed crying to sleep as you begin to understand the lyrical masterpieces the songs on the album are and the songwriting genius that Taylor Swift is. She makes a lot of references and figures of speech on this album, prompting songwriters, English majors, and scholars to attempt to dissect the messages in each song.`,
